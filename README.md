# 🧠 Sovereign-Node-AI: The Autonomous Sentient Network Brain

**Sovereign-Node-AI** is a pioneering framework designed to transform passive network infrastructure (RTN, Fiber, and RAN) into **autonomous, sentient entities**. Moving beyond traditional reactive automation, this project introduces "Biological Wisdom" into network management.

### 🌟 The Philosophy
Traditional systems like AMAC or ATPC react blindly to signal drops. **Sovereign-Node-AI** mimics a biological nervous system, allowing a node to "feel" its internal state and external environment before acting. It prioritizes long-term hardware survival and service stability over aggressive, short-sighted performance boosts.

### 🧠 Core Intelligence Layers
* **Interoception (Internal Health):** The node monitors its "vitals"—CPU load, board temperature, and hardware fatigue. It recognizes when it is "feverish" and needs cooling.
* **Exteroception (Environmental Awareness):** Integrated with geographic data (e.g., the **Djelfa-Brain** database), the node senses external stressors like high-velocity wind gusts, extreme heat, or frequency interference from neighboring links.
* **The Sovereign Decision:** Instead of a "nervous" reaction to a signal drop, the node evaluates its physical capability. If internal heat is too high, it may choose a "Tactical Retreat"—lowering capacity to prevent hardware burnout.



### 🚀 Key Features
* **Resilience Damping:** Distinguishes between a "sneeze" (5-second transient interference) and a persistent failure, preventing unnecessary network oscillations.
* **Proactive Survival Mode:** Automatically triggers maximum cooling and load-balancing during extreme thermal stress.
* **Context-Aware Mitigation:** Identifies if a performance drop is due to physical obstruction or frequency conflict with nearby towers.
